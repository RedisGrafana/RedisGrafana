    Query, visualize, alert on, and understand your data no matter where it’s stored. With Grafana you can create, explore and share all of your data through beautiful, flexible dashboards.

## Unify your data, not your database

Grafana doesn’t require you to ingest data to a backend store or vendor database. Instead, Grafana takes a unique approach to providing a “single-pane-of-glass” by unifying your existing data, wherever it lives.

## Open Source, Cloud and Enterprise

Grafana is available as [open source self-managed](https://grafana.com/oss/), [fully managed observability stack in Cloud](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/) and [self-managed Enterprise](https://grafana.com/products/enterprise/) versions.

## Plugins

Connect your tools and your teams with [Grafana plugins](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/). Data source plugins hook into existing data sources via APIs and render the data in real time without requiring you to migrate or ingest your data.
