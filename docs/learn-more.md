### [Real-time observability with Redis and Grafana](https://grafana.com/go/observabilitycon/real-time-observability-with-redis-and-grafana/)

!!! quote "October 26, 2020 at ObservabilityCON"

    Do you want to learn how to combine Grafana streaming capabilities with interactivity to take Grafana beyond observability? In this session, you’ll learn about the integration of Grafana and Redis, the most loved in-memory database. We will present 3 real-life applications built with Redis Data Source for Grafana. Additionally, we’ll show you how to use the Redis Data Source and demonstrate the new Application plugin with custom panel and dashboards. Finally, we will touch on the new features of Grafana 7: data frames, transformations, and streaming.
